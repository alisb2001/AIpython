# AIpython
This task is a Python AI model that can remove the background from images. This AI model is able to take an image as input and generate a version of the image with the background removed. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate background removal algorithm

## Introduction

Removing backgrounds from images is a common image processing task, often used in graphic design, e-commerce, and more. Our Background Removal Project simplifies this process by providing a pre-trained model that can quickly and accurately remove backgrounds from your images.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the Background Removal Project, please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Required Python Libraries**: These can be installed using pip by running:

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
